# Connect to Terminal

<div class="conduit-notice">
    <strong>Heads up!</strong> This is an experimental feature. Launching a native application from a web page is admittedly a bit strange, and because the Conduit helper application is self-signed, your operating system or antivirus software may require additional steps to grant it permission to run. You can review the source code on <a href="https://github.com/blakjakau/dev.jakbox.conduit" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
</div>

To use the integrated terminal, a small, secure helper application called **Conduit** must be installed and running on your local machine. It acts as a bridge to your system's shell.
